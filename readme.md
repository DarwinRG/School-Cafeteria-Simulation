# üçΩÔ∏è School Cafeteria Simulation

This project simulates the operations of a school cafeteria using the SimPy library. It models the behavior of students arriving at the cafeteria, waiting in line, and being served by cashiers and servers.

## ‚ú® Features

- Simulates student arrivals and service times
- Models multiple stores within the cafeteria
- Tracks waiting times and queue lengths
- Generates plots for analysis
